# WaterDispenser

The proposed IoT-based water dispenser system fulfils pets' daily water intake and tracks their consumption. The system is suitable for those pet parents who do not have enough time to dedicate to their pets due to work. The pet parents can get statistical data about water consumption through mobile and web interfaces.
